The project, built in C#, includes a wide range of functionalities used in a retinal image segmentation algorithm designed to detect common indicators of diabetic retinopathy. These features cover color space conversion, image segmentation, and image classification. The project also integrates key mathematical operations frequently used in image processing tasks...

The C #- based graphic user interface (GUI) allows the user to upload the original retinal image and save the processed image. The user can visualize thestage of the image processing. The user can view the RGB retinal image converted to different color spaces, such as CMYK, YCbCr, and GLM. Some of the Image processing results using the application are shown in the figure below:
